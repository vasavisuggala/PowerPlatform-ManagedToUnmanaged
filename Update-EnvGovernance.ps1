.SYNOPSIS
    PowerShell script to convert a Power Platform environment from Managed to Unmanaged.

.DESCRIPTION
    In Microsoft Power Platform, environments can be manually upgraded from Unmanaged to Managed. 
    However, reversing this change (Managed to Unmanaged) is not supported in the Admin Center UI. 
    This script allows tenant admins to programmatically downgrade an environment from Managed to Unmanaged.

    Use this when:
    - A project team no longer requires strict governance for an environment.
    - Premium licensing costs for Managed environments are no longer affordable.
    - You need to correct an accidental governance configuration.
